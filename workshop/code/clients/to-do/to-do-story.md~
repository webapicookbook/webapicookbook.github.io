# Simple ToDo

## Purpose
We need to track 'ToDo' records in order to improve both timeliness 
and accuracy of customer follow-up activity.

## Data
In this first pass at the application, we need to keep track of the 
following data properties: 

 * **id** : a globally unique value for each ToDo record
 * **body** : the text content of the ToDo record

## Actions
This edition of the application needs to support the following operations:

 * **Home** : starting location of the service
 * **List** : return a list of all active ToDo records in the system
 * **Add** : add a new ToDo record to the system
 * **Remove** : remove a completed ToDo record from the system
